        <h2>UI and UX Decisions</h2>
        <p> The UI and UX design of my Spector & Co website aims to deliver a professional, seamless experience that
            embodies the high-end, authoritative nature of a legal consultancy personified by Harvey Spector. Each
            element
            is crafted to enhance usability, readability, and visual cohesion, ensuring the site feels both approachable
            and
            trustworthy. Here’s an overview of the key design choices:</p>

        <h3>UI Elements</h3>
        <p><strong>• Navigation Bar:</strong> The navigation bar uses Navy Blue (#002B5C) as a grounding colour,
            providing a strong visual
            anchor at the top of each page. Its minimalistic style and consistent placement allow users to easily access
            different sections from the header to the footer, supporting a very smooth but also a seamless experience.
        </p>
        <p><strong>• Buttons and Calls to Action:</strong> <button class="button-variation-1">Call to Action</button>Key
            action buttons use Teal (#008080) for high visibility and
            urgency, drawing
            users’ attention to essential actions like "Contact Us" or "Learn More." Secondary buttons like the scroll
            down and the scroll to top are styled with more consideration in mine.
            For example: the robin egg blue colour on the back to top button on the bottom right is used to clearly
            distinguish it from the footer if the user gets to the bottom, moreover the colour is used to stand out
            among the other buttons on the page.

            Furthermore we have the scroll down button <button id="scroll-button" class="scroll-text"> scroll down
                ↓</button>, that is styled with the
            splash images in mind. With white for text and box-shadow: 0 0 20px rgba(0, 128, 128, 0.5) to clearly
            distnguish it from the backsplash images, especially when hovering the buttons fills with white and changes
            the text colour, to futher emphasise that we are able to interacted but the distinction between the hover
            and the splash images is certainly more noticeable.</p>



        <p></p>
        <p><strong> • Interactive Elements:</strong> To encourage exploration, interactive elements such as a
            scroll-triggered section
            reveals and a "Click or Scroll to Learn More" button that was mentioned previously, allow users to navigate
            intuitively. Robin Egg Blue
            (#39CECE) is used sparingly as an accent, adding vibrancy and guiding the eye toward interactive components,
            but
            also largely used for numerous hover effects, especially on the navigation bar it provides the need contrast
            in
            comparison to Teal.</p>



        <h2>UX Considerations</h2>
        <p><strong>• Readability and Accessibility:</strong> Font sizes and contrast levels were chosen to maximize
            readability. The Navy
            Blue and Deep Gray tones provide clear contrast against lighter backgrounds, while Platinum (#E5E5E5) and
            Baby
            Powder (#FFFDF8) keep the overall aesthetic refined and uncluttered. Furthermore, the aim was to stay away
            from
            White (#FFFFFF) to prevent eye strain on users with such a harsh shade of white, and therefore platinum and
            baby
            powder is used on certain darker backgrounds for the text.</p>
        <p><strong> • Consistent Visual Language:</strong> By sticking to a limited colour palette and consistent
            typography, the site builds
            a recognizable, cohesive identity. Each UI element adheres to this visual language, from the navigation bar
            to
            the form fields, reinforcing brand recognition and professionalism.</p>
        <p><strong> • Guided Navigation: </strong>The use of smooth transitions to certain areas by having buttons to
            navigate and gradual reveals makes the user
            journey fluid, allowing
            users to consume content in manageable, engaging sections. The experience is designed to be straightforward,
            minimizing friction and guiding users naturally through the website.</p>

        <p><strong>Font Choice:</strong> Helvetica, a sans-serif font that exudes professionalism and confidence, widely
            used by brands like BMW and American Airlines.</p>
        <p><strong>Consistency:</strong> Helvetica will be used across all headings (H1-H6) and body text to maintain
            readability and a clean appearance, the idea is to maintin professionalism across the site and Helvetica was
            chosen because it offers that.</p>
