            <h2>1. Project Overview</h2>
            <p>This project will seek to critically analyse a data driven journalism piece titled “How the virus got
                out” written by Jin WuWeiyi, CaiDerek Watkins and James Glanz. This data driven journalism piece was
                published by the New York Times on the 22nd of March in 2020, where the piece attempts to illustrate how
                the Covid-19 rapidly moved across the world, from its origin in Wuhan, China.</p>
            <p>Despite efforts to contain the virus, with the travel restrictions being a priority to prevent Covid-19
                from further spreading to the rest of the world. The piece makes use of visualization through a series
                of maps, with a series of basic animations on each of the maps that define the movement of the virus.
            </p>

            <h2>2. Data Visualization Techniques</h2>

            <figure>
                <img src="../../Theory/Image1.png" alt="Visual representation of the virus’s (red dots) movement through a map.">
                <figcaption>Figure 2.1: Visual representation of the virus’s (red dots) movement through a map.
                </figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p><strong>Why was this method of representation/visualization chosen?</strong></p>
            <p>Firstly, maps are effective in the representation of any form of spatial data, especially data in
                relation to that of regions and/or any form of geographical location of any nature. Tufte alluded to
                this idea of maps in his book "The Visual Display of Quantitative Information”, where he expressed the
                utility in maps to show geographic distributions and movement, and how this directly translates to
                spatial relationships.</p>

            <figure>
                <img src="../../Theory/Image2.png"
                    alt="Visual representation of the blue dots (travellers) and red dots (infections).">
                <figcaption>Figure 2.2: Visual representation of the blue dots (travellers) the red dots (infections).
                </figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p><strong>The clarity of information and the effectiveness of colours</strong></p>
            <p>The map is clear in the way that conveys this idea of spatial relationships. For example, this idea of
                space through the way the red dots are effectively scattered from one location on the map to another,
                and it shows the effectiveness of the transportation and the movement of the virus from one location to
                another. With certain areas having more dots scattered on top of each other showing the effectiveness,
                of also identifying areas with a greater number of cases of Covid-19 infections.</p>
            <p>Moreover, and adding into this idea of how clear the information is we can see that the choice of the
                colour red amongst the plain white and grey background, and in contrast to the dark blue shade of that
                is used for the non-infected travellers, clarifies the data and allows for the data to be read more
                accurately. The colour stands out and allows for one to interpret the data much easier and more
                accurately and accessible in the sense of trying to comprehend.</p>

            <figure>
                <img src="../../Theory/Image3.png" alt="Start of the infection animation and the map.">
                <figcaption>Figure 2.3: Start of the infection animation and the map.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p><strong>How do design elements enhance the message?</strong></p>
            <p>The use of red dots would have created this feeling of urgency and seriousness, that directly corresponds
                with this idea of a pandemic. Red creates an emotional touch, therefore making the visualization
                impactful. Furthermore, the visualization includes animations, that firstly show the movement of the
                virus in Figure 2.1 and Figure 2.2. Secondly, the animations convey how the rate of infection gradually
                increases over about 1-2 second of viewing the visualization, with the animations starting off as Figure
                2.3 and ending off as Figure 2.1. This animation enhances the rapidness of the infections spreading, and
                it’s done through showing the viewer how fast that transition takes place between starting with so few
                dots and thereafter rapidly increasing the number of dots on the screen as well as the locations they
                have spread to.</p>

            <h2>3. Interactivity and User Engagement</h2>

            <figure>
                <img src="../../Theory/Image4.png"
                    alt="Upon the third scroll the user will see this, the first site of the red dot which is known as the infection.">
                <figcaption>Figure 3.1: Upon the third scroll the user will see this, the first site of the red dot
                    which is known as the infection.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <figure>
                <img src="../../Theory/Image5.png" alt="Change in the map locations after scrolling down.">
                <figcaption>Figure 3.2: Change in the map locations after scrolling down.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p><strong>Interactivity</strong></p>
            <p>In his book Interactive Data Visualization for the Web, Murray expressed the idea that interactivity
                allows for deeper user engagement, as a user is afforded the ability to manipulate and explore the data
                through interactive elements of some sort, thereby having a greater chance potentially making the
                visualization more informative and insightful.</p>
            <p>In the case of this piece, interactivity and/or an interactive element is defined through the user
                scrolling. Upon each time the user scrolls down once, the user is fed with new information on the
                outbreak, seeing that this piece is progressive in the sense of the information and the data that is
                tries to convey as we see rapid movements of the red dots but also the rapid change in the map location
                as a user scrolls down, which can be seen in Figure 3.1 which directly relates to Figure 2.1 that shows
                the direct relationship of the red dots. Each time the user scrolls the user is fed with new and even at
                times a new map or new location that continues the story as seen in Figure 3.2. The takeaway is that
                more and progressive information is constantly updated after a scroll, that not only keeps the user
                engaged but also encourages the user to explore at their own pace.</p>
            <p>As mentioned earlier with Figure 2.1 and Figure 3.1, the information and the visuals are all
                interconnected with previous information obtained, as this journal seeks to tell a story about COVID 19,
                however this all directly relates to the progression of the outbreak.</p>

            <h2>4. Personal Theoretical Insights from UX and UI Design Principles</h2>

            <p><strong>Striving for clarity and aiming for simplicity</strong></p>
            <p>As mentioned earlier and directly in line with a course reading, “The Basic Principles of User Interface
                Design”, the clear use of red dots against a white/grey background demonstrates an effective approach to
                clarity in terms of reading the data of infections as well as understanding its visual representation
                and significance. This choice certainly makes the data stand out and helps users easily interpret the
                data, as well as keeps the consistency through the data journalism piece. The choices do reflect the
                importance of visual clarity in communication and make use of one method of interaction, and when
                piecing all these important design choices together we are able to see showing a direct relation to the
                core principles that are often outlined in UX and UI Design principles and more so emphasized in the
                course reading.</p>

            <p><strong>Usability</strong></p>
            <p>The piece makes use of scrolling to reveal different stages of the virus's spread aligns with my insights
                into usability. It allows users to explore the data at their own pace, making the interaction intuitive
                and engaging.</p>

            <p><strong>Feedback</strong></p>
            <p>The nature of the of this journalism piece updates as users scroll, and this provides immediate feedback
                on a user’s interactions.</p>

            <p><strong>Emotional Impact and UX</strong></p>
            <p>According to a course reading, “User experience - a research agenda” by Marc Hassenzahl & Noam Tr
