        <h2>UI/UX Design Decisions</h2>
        <p>The <strong>UI/UX design</strong> of <strong>Spector & Co</strong> focuses on creating a clear, professional,
            and engaging experience. The minimalist design uses a <strong>sophisticated navy blue color scheme</strong>
            to build trust and align with the brand identity. <strong>Typography</strong> features Helvetica for
            readability, with clear distinctions between headings and body text. <strong>Interactive elements</strong>
            like hover effects on buttons and links provide feedback, encouraging user engagement. Finally,
            <strong>white space</strong> is strategically used to reduce cognitive load and improve the overall user
            experience.</p>

        <h3>Key Design Decisions:</h3>
        <ul>

        <h2>Folder Structure</h2>
        <p>In order to maintain a clean and organized project, the folder structure is designed with scalability in
            mind. Below is an overview of the folder structure used in the Spector & Co website project:</p>

        <!-- Display the folder structure image -->

            style="width:100%; max-width:350px; margin-top: 20px;">

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Images:</strong> Contains all images used in the website, including wireframes, logos, and other
                assets.</li>
